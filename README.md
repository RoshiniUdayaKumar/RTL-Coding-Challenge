## 50-Day RTL Coding Challenge

Welcome to  the 50-Day RTL Coding Challenge!
This repository contains my journey of designing and implementing various digital circuits and systems using Verilog for 50 days. Each day focuses on a specific topic or project, showcasing different aspects of RTL design and simulation. 

Tools Used: 
Xilinx Vivado for design and simulation. 
Open source like EDA playground can also be used as an alternative for Xilinx Vivado.

Features:
1. Design: Well-commented Verilog code for each project
2. Testbenches: Input test stimulus to verify the functionality of the design
3. Circuit: Describe the logical connectivity for each project
4. Simulations: Waveforms/expected output attached for each project

Goals:
1. Enhance proficiency in Verilog programming
2. Develop a strong foundation in digital logic design
3. Create a portfolio of RTL projects for future reference and career opportunities
